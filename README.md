# Lubo-Motkov-employees
I made a decision to make this task to a full stack project.
To start Backend :
First: open a terminal and go to directory /Backend/employee-api and run npm install,
Second:when you in directory  /Backend/employee-api run in terminal npm run start:dev.
And now backend is start on port 4000.

To start Frontend:
First:you must go to /Frontend/employe-front in Terminal
Second when you in directory  /Frontend/employe-front type in Terminal npm install
And now react is started on port 3000.

To see project go to http://localhost:3000.
